# 1. SMB
Using enum4linux to get information about the shared drive
```
The syntax of Enum4Linux is nice and simple: "enum4linux [options] ip"

TAG            FUNCTION

-U             get userlist
-M             get machine list
-N             get namelist dump (different from -U and-M)
-S             get sharelist
-P             get password policy information
-G             get group and member list

-a             all of the above (full basic enumeration)

```

Exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.
Using SMB client to access anonymous share
```
"smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]"

Followed by the tags:

-U [name] : to specify the user

-p [port] : to specify the port

```

# Telnet

```
1. telnet IP PORT might give you anonymous login
	sometimes leaks username

2. Bruteforce login

3. Check for CVE


```

# FTP
1. Try for Anonymous Login
`ftp IP PORT`

2. Try to upload reverse shell, and see if you can exploit it
`put ~/location_to_rev_shell`

3. Also try to bruteforce ftp if you found the username somehow
```
"hydra -t 4 -l dale -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.10.6 ftp"

Let's break it down:

SECTION             FUNCTION

hydra                   Runs the hydra tool

-t 4                    Number of parallel connections per target

-l [user]               Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise

-P [path to dictionary] Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords

-vV                     Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt

[machine IP]            The IP address of the target machine

ftp / protocol          Sets the protocol

```

# NFS

#### List shares in NFS
```bash
showmount -e $IP
```

#### Mounting NFS shares

Your clientâ€™s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create
this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so:

```
sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock

Let's break this down
	
Tag 	Function
sudo 	Run as root
mount 	Execute the mount command
-t nfs 	Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS
IP:share 	The IP Address of the NFS server, and the name of the share we wish to mount
-nolock 	Specifies not to use NLM locking
```

# SMTP

### Enumerating SMTP
`Find SMTP Basic Information`
```
msfconsole
	auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version
```

`Full SMTP enumeration`
```
Searches for username of SMTP server
msfconsole
	search smtp_enum
	use the listed auxiliary module
	PS: This requires username wordlists to enumerate 
	users
```

PS: If any username returns we can try to bruteforce those for SSH or any
kind of services available

# MYSQL

`Try Default Credentials to login`
credentials: "root:password

mysql -h [IP] -u [username] -p portNUm
